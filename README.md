# Overview of Project
### Purpose & Background
Steve reach out to create a macro to process stocks for 2017 and 2018. We will be refactoring the macro code used to process stocks for 2017 and 2018 to process more and save time the code takes to process. Steve wants his parents to use the macro to process the entire stock market over the last few years.
# Results 
### Analysis & code
I copied the code provided by Steve. Used previous code block from earlier lessons and modified them to work as indicated by Steve's outline.  
# Summary
### Advantages of Refactoring Code
The first one would be saving time. There are always new ways of writing a code that can improve the code, like an oil change to a car. Another advantage of refactoring code would be to keep it up to date since.
### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The time to refactor a code can be time-consuming, leading to bugs and errors. Finding solutions to the bugs and errors can be time-consuming for the team. Customers will be irritated with a product with bugs that had not previously been there. Code might not run on legacy systems.
### Advantage of Original Code
The first solution the team found to the error or outline the company wanted to accomplish. Code functions correctly in the company ecosystem.
### Disadvantage of Original Code
The original code might be outdated, using no longer used methods. Integrating code with new software can have difficulty having different standards of basic functionality.
